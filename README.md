# Distance_Measuring_System
```
The project is designed and implemented based on the layered architecture
```
1. Using **ATmega 32** Microcontroller with frequency **8 Mhz**.
2. Measuring the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04.
3. The LCD should display the distance value.
4. The project should be design and implemented based on the layered architecture model as follow:
